Provides an option to restrict the properties which are allowed to be modified by a JSON PATCH operation.

## Installation

You can either get this package by downloading it from the NuGet Package Manager built in Visual Studio, in the [releases](https://github.com/TwentyFourMinutes/JsonPatch.Restrict/releases) tab or from the official [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/JsonPatch.Restrict) website. 

Also you can install it via the **P**ackage **M**anager **C**onsole:

```
Install-Package JsonPatch.Restrict
```

### Basic example

```c#
public class DummyModel
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Value { get; set; }
}

var patchDocument = new JsonPatchDocument();
patchDocument.Replace("/Value", "newValue");

patchDocument.ApplyToWithRestrictions(dummy, "Value"); // Allows the Patch to only modify the Value property. This argument takes an array.
```
### Disclaimer

Every method has a `Try` implementation which wraps around the error lambda, which ussually has to be passed. Also do Note this doesn't work for nested objects. If needed let me know in an issue.  

### Acknowledgements

I also want to mention the [`JsonPatch.Patchable`](https://github.com/Labradoratory/JsonPatch.Patchable) package, from which this library is heavily insipred. The reason for this package to exist, is due to the fact that `JsonPatch.Patachable` enforces DDD violations by applying attributes on your domain entities.
